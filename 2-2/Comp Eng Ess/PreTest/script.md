Meeting 1: OK everyone, shall we make a start? I’d like to welcome you all to this meeting. As you know, we’re
here today to decide on a new evaluation system for teachers of the faculty. I suggest we go round the table first
to get some ideas. Then we can discuss them afterwards. Since some of us have other meetings to attend, I’d like
to finish by three o’clock. So, Lisa, perhaps you’d like to start?

Meeting 2. Good afternoon everyone. Let’s get started, shall we? Thank you for coming today. The purpose of this
meeting is to discuss an initial plan to extend the Airlink system. As you can see from the agenda, there are five
items for discussion. This meeting is due to finish at approximately five o’clock, so I would like to limit each item to
30 minutes. So, the first item in the agenda is Background.
